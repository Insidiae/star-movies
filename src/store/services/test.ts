        "The greatest adventure of all time begins with Star Trek, the incredible story of a young crew's maiden voyage onboard the most advanced starship ever created: the U.S.S. Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind. The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James Kirk (Chris Pine), is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock (Zachary Quinto), was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone before.",

A test run takes an unexpected turn, however, when the starship encounters two vessels trapped inside the Nexus, a mysterious energy ribbon. During a perilous rescue attempt, Kirk is swept out into space. Seven decades later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of Enterprise-D rescue an El Aurian physicist named Soran. Unbeknownst to Picard, Soran harbors a deadly plan that includes the destruction of the Enterprise and millions of lives. Now Picard's only hope for a future rests within the Nexus...and a legendary captain from the past.",

Sparks immediately fly between these two strangers, who might never have met had fate not given them a little push. But will fate be enough to take these teens from star-crossed to lucky in love? With just hours left on the clock in what looks to be her last day in the U.S., Natasha is fighting against her family’s deportation as fiercely as she’s fighting her budding feelings for Daniel, who is working just as hard to convince her they are destined to be together. A modern-day story about finding love against all odds, “The Sun Is Also a Star” explores whether our lives are determined by fate or the random events of the universe.",

        "A Star is Born marked Judy Garland's return to movies after a four-year absence, director George Cukor's first musical and first color film, and a showcase for great Harold Arden/Ira Gershwin songs in state-of-the-art stereo. One of the most beloved show-business stories of all time, it represents a career peak for many involved. Garland is singer Esther Blodgett, an undeniable talent on the rise. She catches the eye of Norman Maine (James Mason), an alcoholic actor in career decline. Their intense love transforms them both. Only one will survive Hollywood's slings and arrows. Shortened in response to exhibitor complaints after its premiers, the movie underwent one rebirth in 1983 when film historian Ronald Haver found almost all the cut sequences and supervised a reconstruction to near its original length. Its new rebirth is this breathtaking digital surround stereo track and incorporating picture and musical material recently found in the vaults. Star always had a shine to it. Now watch it sparkle as never before.",

        "A beautiful depiction of love and loss, Campion’s film Bright Star charts the sad love affair between the nineteenth-century poet John Keats and his neighbour and lover, Fanny Brawne, during the years in which the poet penned much of the most celebrated verse in the Romantic period. Narrated from Brawne’s view on the romance, the movie not only uncovers the evolution of their young romance, but traces Fanny’s introduction into and fascination with Keats’s world of poetry, starting with indifference and ending with heartfelt involvement. At the time the two people meet in 1818 once Keats has properly set himself up in the literary world. However, his job does not enable him the financial means to marry. With this knowledge, Brawne’s interaction with Keats is stymied, so she throws herself into his world by feigning a fascination with poetry. Keats’s poetry counts among some of the greatest works in British literature.",

        "Chili Palmer, a cocky and smooth Miami loan shark/obsessive movie buff, is asked by a Las Vegas casino to go to Los Angeles to convince schlocky exploitation-film mogul Harry Zimm to make good on his gambling marker. Once Chili discovers that \"I don't think the producer has to know too much,\" he sees no reason why he shouldn't be getting some of that action as well...and, besides, being a success in the movie business is a piece of cake for those schooled in more traditional criminal pursuits. Based on the 1990 novel by Elmore Leonard.",

        "When Star Wars landed in the theaters, it introduced audiences to a galaxy filled with heroes and villains, robots and space ships, and a dizzying variety of alien life. But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. Like no toys before them, Star Wars toys were a phenomenon that swept the nation, permanently transforming both the toy and movie industries, and ultimately creating a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over its fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts and authors like Stephen Sansweet and Gus Lopez, and of course collectors, it looks at the toys’ history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today.",

        "When Anne Shirley turns thirteen, she faces complex issues with her friends, inspirational adults and Marilla and Matthew. At the same time, she begins a friendship with Gilbert Blythe that emotionally escalates to disrupt the status quo of her peaceful world. Her free-spirited nature is challenged by her perceived need to become sensible, and her journey toward this goal is fraught with confusion and more than a few unfortunate – albeit, amusing - mishaps. Through school events and playtime after class, Anne continues to deepen her bosom friendship with Diana Barry. It almost sours when she frightens the living daylights out of Diana’s elderly Aunt Josephine. Just when all is forgiven, their friendship faces an even more profound test when Anne begins to spend more time with Gilbert. Meanwhile, at Green Gables, Matthew’s health begins to slide. During an outing into the forest, he becomes disoriented and must rely on Anne to find their way home. He implores Anne to hide the incident from Marilla. Anne struggles with her promise to Matthew but she’s not one to harbour secrets. In the end, she confesses to Marilla and wrestles with the burden of her betrayal to Matthew. The rising tension between Anne, her girlfriends and Gilbert culminates with a daring river rescue. Gilbert saves Anne and relishes his moment as her hero. Although Anne is grateful to Gilbert, she must make a decision that breaks his heart.",
